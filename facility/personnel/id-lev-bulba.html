	<h2>BULBA, Lev</h2>
	<p>Specialty: PHYSICIST</p>
	<p>
		BULBA was selected for this research project for his specialty in the physics</br>
		of low-gravity environments. The artifacts recovered in the Nadbor Exclusion</br>
		Zone exhibit strange low-gravity properties on their surroundings. Both BULBA</br>
		and PETERKA were brought in as specialists for this project.
